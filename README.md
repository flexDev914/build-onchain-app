## Keep in mind

When using Build Onchain Apps remember

- To remove global installation via `npm uninstall -g @base-org/build-onchain-apps` or `yarn global remove @base-org/build-onchain-apps` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.
- [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f)
