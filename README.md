# [Build Onchain Apps](https://github.com/base-org/build-onchain-apps)

> The easier way to build onchain apps.

<br />

Building an Onchain Application can feel overwhelming due to the many libraries, best practices, and choices developers and entrepreneurs must make. **Build Onchain Apps** as a library focuses on automating and simplifying the creation of new Onchain Apps and enhancing existing ones.

We just started; stay tuned for more to come!!! ‚òïÔ∏è üîµ

## Getting Started

npx @base-org/build-onchain-apps@latest create <TEMPLATE_APP>

</p>

If you've previously installed `@base-org/build-onchain-apps` globally via `npm install -g @base-org/build-onchain-apps`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g @base-org/build-onchain-apps` or `yarn global remove @base-org/build-onchain-apps` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_
